# Java Memory Agent Add-On

The **Java Memory Agent** package implements automatic RAM usage optimization for Java-powered stacks of any type (application servers, databases, etc) by adjusting the most essential Java memory parameters according to the amount of resources, allocated to a container.

**What it is intended for?**

This add-on is designed to optimize any custom Java server (i.e. hosted with [Docker containers](https://docs.jelastic.com/dockers-overview) or on top of [VPS](https://docs.jelastic.com/vps)). Herewith, it is applicable not only to application server stacks (e.g. _Tomcat_, _WildFly_, _GlassFish_, etc), but to any Java-powered instance as well (e.g. _Neo4j_ or _Cassandra_ databases).

> **Note:** Jelastic-managed Java stacks are provisioned with a similar tuning out-of-box, thus their additional optimization with this add-on is not needed.

To learn more about [Jelastic Add-ons](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/jpswiki/wiki/Jelastic-Addons) and their usage, refer to the linked guide.

## Java Memory Agent Add-On Specific

To implement the required configurations, the following changes are applied by this add-on upon installation:
* _**[supervisor.sh](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/java-memory-agent/blob/master/scripts/supervisor.sh)**_ - intercepts _java_ command on a shell level to analyze and substitute default start options with optimized ones
* _**[memoryConfig.sh](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/java-memory-agent/blob/master/scripts/memoryConfig.sh)**_ - adjusts the most essential Java parameters, like: _-Xmx_, _-Xms_, _-Xmn_, _-Xmaxf_, _-Xminf_, _-XX:MaxPermSize_ and GC type; herewith, parameters defined via environment variables won’t be changed
* _**[javaagent](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/java-memory-agent/tree/master/lib)**_ - performs periodical Full GC calls to reduce the memory usage and release unused RAM back to OS. To disable this functionality please define environment variable _VERT_SCALING=false_. 

In addition, the Java Memory Agent by Jelastic considers all the specific issues of [Java hosting within containers](http://blog.jelastic.com/2017/04/13/java-ram-usage-in-containers-top-5-tips-not-to-lose-your-memory/) (e.g. incorrect memory limits determination, native non-heap memory usage, RAM adjustment on a fly, etc.). This allows to improve stability and reliability of your application in general.

> **Note:** Upon add-on installation, the corresponding server should be restarted with new parameters, which will cause a brief downtime of the service it runs.
> 
> In order to avoid this, consider to [increase the number of instances](https://docs.jelastic.com/multi-nodes) within a target environment layer so that the required changes could be applied sequentially, by restarting them one-by-one.

Herewith, the originally used application parameters are automatically backed up and could be easily restored with a simple add-on removal, if needed (see the details within the dedicated section below).

## How to Install Java Memory Agent to Jelastic Environment

The **Java Memory Agent** add-on can be applied to the required server by [importing](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-import) the _**manifest.jps**_ file above.

Within the appeared form, use the appropriate drop-down lists to specify the environment and Java-running server that should be optimized:
* _**Environment name**_ - choose a target environment within your account
* _**Nodes**_ - select the corresponding environment layer with the required server

Click **Install** when ready and wait a few minutes for your application memory usage to be properly adjusted by Jelastic.

After the successful installation, you can open the embedded [statistic monitoring](https://docs.jelastic.com/view-app-statistics) tool to track your server’s RAM consumption with new settings.

## How to Restore the Initial Java Parameters

Upon installation, the Java Memory Agent add-on automatically preserves the previously used Java settings within a dedicated backup file. Consequently, these configs can be effortlessly restored through the add-on removal, if needed.

For that, click on the **Add-ons** button next to the corresponding environment layer to open the same-named tab and select the **Uninstall** option within the _Java Memory Agent_  menu.
